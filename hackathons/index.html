	<h2><i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> Hackathons</h2>
	<p>Hackathons are events where a bunch of "hackers" come together in teams with the intention of creating the best type of program (i.e. web app, iPhone app, etc) within a certain period of time. Most hackathons last between 24-48 hours and are full of caffeine, food, prizes, and little sleep.</p>
